### Chapter 1: Foundational Concepts - Summary

This section covers the fundamental concepts required to understand computer networking.

* **Core Models**: Networking follows standardized, layered models like **OSI** and **TCP/IP** to ensure devices can communicate. Data is organized into Protocol Data Units (PDUs) like segments, packets, and frames as it moves through these layers.
* **Data Flow**: Data is prepared for transmission through **encapsulation**, where headers are added as data moves down the layers. The receiving device performs **decapsulation**, stripping those headers as the data moves up.
* **Network Architecture**: Networks are classified by size, such as LAN, WAN, MAN, and PAN. For efficient design, a **hierarchical model** consisting of Core, Distribution, and Access layers is used.
* **Troubleshooting Tools**: Essential command-line tools like **`ping`**, **`traceroute`**, and **`ipconfig`/`ifconfig`** are dual-use. While administrators use them for diagnostics, attackers use them for network reconnaissance.
